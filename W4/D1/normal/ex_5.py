# Predict the output of the following code snippets:

#>>> 5 < 3
#false
# print(5 < 3)
#>> 3 == 3
# true4
# print(3 == 3)
#>>> 3 == "3" # problem here when you compare digit with string => False
#true
# print(3 == "3")
#>>> "3" > 3
#error can't compare between str and int
# print("3" > 3)
#>>> "Hello" == "hello"
#false
# print("Hello" == "hello")
